# SQL_Project
#Python socket project for sql databases (opensource)
Python script to create and transport data to and from a sql database as a part of an open source project as well as test for security issues and deployed penetration testing.  After some operating system issues with my new Mac and El Capitan OS that is not compatable with the MySQL package I had to find a workaround that ate up a bit of time but now I have an update to the project. So far I have the socket set up and the connection with the python socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) with allows me to make a TCP stream connection I can then add in the SSL logic and the sql query which is causing the bulk of the problems at this point. The connection and ssl works great but the query logic will likely be moved to another py file as opposed to being in a "trigger" so that I can make it as efficient as possible and then query the data and return the result directly to some python functionality. More to come.

#Update
I went back to make some changes to the query and brought it out of the function and put it as a global variable. I hope to create a function and set the parser to a command line argument that will allow the user to pass a database table and arguments that call on the function to return the correct query but for now the global variable will have to do with the local sqlite package. I made those changes because after running through the database_server code with pylint I found some significent security vulnerabilities but I was able to make the necessary changes and raise the source code score above an 8.
