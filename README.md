# SQL_Project
#Python socket project for sql databases (opensource)
#Python script to create and transport data to and from a sql database as a part of an open source project as well as test #for security issues and deployed penetration testing.  After some operating system issues with my new Mac and El Capitan OS #that is not compatable with the MySQL package I had to find a workaround that ate up a bit of time but now I have an update #to the project. So far I have the socket set up and the connection with the python socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, #socket.SOCK_STREAM) with allows me to make a TCP stream connection I can then add in the SSL logic and the sql query which #is causing the bulk of the problems at this point. The connection and ssl works great but the query logic will likely be #moved to another py file as opposed to being in a "trigger" so that I can make it as efficient as possible and then query #the data and return the result directly to some python functionality. More to come.
